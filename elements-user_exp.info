To the Second Edition
=====================

This book is no longer just about web sites.  Overall, the themes,
concepts, and principles apply to products and services of all kinds.

   The field of user experience has broadened its horizons.
Practitioners now regularly talk about the impact and value of user
experience design in areas far beyond the limited context of the Web or
even screen-based interactive applications that dominated the
conversation back when this book was first written.

   The Web is still central to the book, if only to acknowledge the
model’s roots in that medium.  But this book doesn’t require an
insider’s knowledge of how Web development happens—so even if you don’t
create Web sites, you should be able to see how to apply these ideas in
your own work.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: To the First Edition,  Prev: To the Second Edition,  Up: Introduction

To the First Edition
====================

This is not a how-to book.  There are many books out there that explain
how Web sites get made.  This is not one of them.

   This is not a book about technology.  There is not a single line of
code to be found between these covers.

   This is not a book of answers.  Instead, this book is about asking
the right questions.

   This book will tell you what you need to know before you go read
those other books.  If you need the big picture, if you need to
understand the context for the decisions that user experience
practitioners make, this book is for you.

   This book is designed to be read easily in just a few hours.  If
you’re a newcomer to the world of user experience, this book will give
you the foundation you need.  If you’re already familiar with the
methods and concerns of the field of user experience, this book will
help you communicate them more effectively to the people you work with.

Products and services are made by people and someone, somewhere should
get the credit when they work well for us—or get the blame when they
don’t.

1.1 Everyday Miseries
=====================

Everyone, every once in a while, has one of those days.

   ...


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: Introducing User Experience,  Next: From Product Design to User Experience Design,  Prev: Everyday Miseries,  Up: User Experience and Why It Matters

1.2 Introducing User Experience
===============================

   • The accident
   • The register
   • The pump
   • The coffeemaker
   • The Clock

   In short, every one of the previous cases of “bad luck” could have
been avoided had someone made different choices in designing a product
or service.  These examples all demonstrate a lack of attention to the
*user experience*: the experience the product creates for the people who
use it in the real world.  When a product is being developed, people pay
a great deal of attention to what it does.  User experience is the
other, often overlooked, side of the equation—how it works—that can
often make the difference between a successful product and a failure.

   User experience is not about the inner workings of a product or
service.  User experience is about how it works on the outside, where a
person comes into contact with it.  When someone asks you what it’s like
to use a product or service, they’re asking about the user experience.
Is it hard to do simple things?  Is it easy to figure out?  How does it
feel to interact with the product?

   That interaction often involves pushing a lot of buttons, as in the
case of technology products such as alarm clocks, coffeemakers, or cash
registers.  Sometimes its just a matter of simply physical mechanism,
such as the gas cap on your car.  However, every product that is used by
someone creates a user experience: books, ketchup bottles, reclining
armchairs, cardigan sweaters.

   For any kind of product or service, its the little things that count.
Having a button click when you push it down doesn’t seem like much, but
when that click makes the difference between getting coffee and not
getting coffee, it matters a great deal.  Even if you never realized
that the design of that button was causing you trouble, how would you
feel about a coffeemaker that you were able to use successfully only
party of the time?  How would you feel about the manufacturer?  Would
you buy another product from that company in the future?  Probably not.
Thus, for want of a button that clicks, a customer is lost.

1.3 From Product Design to User Experience Design
=================================================

When most people think about product design, they often think of it in
terms of aesthetic appeal: a well-designed product is one that looks
good to the eye and feels good to the touch.  Whether it’s the curve of
a sports car’s body or the texture of a power drill’s grip, the
aesthetic dimension of product design is a sure attention-grabber.

   Another common way people think about product design is in functional
terms: A well-designed product is one that does what it promises to do.
And a badly-designed product is one that somehow doesn’t: scissors that
don’t cut even though the blades are sharp, a pen that doesn’t write
even though it’s full of ink, a printer that constantly jams.

   All of these can certainly be failures of design.  These products
might look great and work well functionally, but designing products with
the user experience as an explicit oucome means looking beyond the
functional or aesthetic.

   #+cindex; product development Some people responsible for creating
products may not think in terms of design at all.  For them, the process
of creating a product is about development: steadily builidng up and
refining the features and functionalities of the product until they add
up to something viable to the marketplace.

   In this view, the design of a product is dictated by its
functionality—or, as designers sometimes put it, “form follows
function.” This approach makes complete sense for the inner workings of
a product, the parts concealed from a user.  But when it comes to teh
parts of a product that are user-facing—the buttons, displays, labels,
and so forth—the “correct” form isn’t dictated by functionality at all.
Instead, its dictated by the psychology and behavior of the users
themselves.

   User experience design often deals with questions of context.
Aesthetic design makes ure the button on the coffeemaker is an appealing
shape and texture.  Functional design makes sure it triggers the
appropriate action on the device.  User experience design makes sure the
aesthetic and functional aspects of the button work in the context of
the rest of the product, asking questions like, “Is the button too small
for such an important function?” User experience design also makes sure
the button works in the context of what the user is trying to
accomplish, asking such quesstions like, “Is the button in the right
place relative to the other controls the user would be using at the same
time?”

1.4 Designing (for) Experience—Use Matters
==========================================

What’s the difference between desigining a product and designing a user
experience?  After all, every product intended for humans has a user,
and every time a product is used, it delivers an experience.  The
product can fail to deliver a satisfactory experience.

   Manufacturers tend not to employ user experience designers.  In
simple cases, the requirements to deliver a successful user experience
are built into the definition of the product itself.

   With more complex products, the requirements to deliver a successful
user experience are independent of the definition of the product.

   And the more complex a product is, the more difficult it becomes to
identify exactly how to deliver a successful experience to the user.
Each additional feature, function, or step in the process of using a
product creates another opportunity for the experience to fall short.
As a result, the process of creating a successful product has to be
quite different.  That’s where product design has to be supported by
user experience design.

1.5 User Experience and the Web
===============================

User experience is vital to all kinds of products and services.  This
book is primarily about the user experience of one particular kind of
product: Web sites.  (_Site_ here refers to both content-oriented Web
products and interactive Web applications.)

   On the Web, user experience becomes even more important than it is
for other kinds of products.  The lessons we’ve learned from creating
user experience on the Web can be applied far beyond its boundaries.

   Web sites are complicated pieces of technology, and something funny
happens when people have trouble using complicated pieces of technology:
They blame themselves.  They feel like they must have done something
wrong.  They feel like they weren’t paying enough attention.  They feel
stupid.  Sure, it’s irrational.  After all, it’s not their fault the
site doesn’t work the wey they expect it to.  But they feel stupid
anyway.  And if you intend to drive people away from your site, it’s
hard to imagine a more effective approach than making them feel stupid
when they use it.

   Regardless of the type of site, in virtually every case, a Web site
is a self-service product.  There is no instruction manual to read
beforehand, no training seminar to attend, no customer service
representative to help guide the user through the site.  There is only
the user, facing the site alone with only her wits and personal
experience to guide her.

   It’s bad enough that she’s been stuck in the position of having to
figure out the site on her own.  The fact that most sites don’t even
acknowledge her helpless condition only makes matters worse., Despite
the vital strategic importance of user experience to the success of a
Web site, the simple matter of understanding what people want and need
has been a low priority for most of the history of the medium.

   If user experience is such a vital part of any Web site, why is it so
often neglected in the development process?  Many Web sites are built
with the idea that being first to market is the key to success,.  In the
earliest days of the Web, sites like Yahoo!  built early leads that
later competitors struggled to overcome.  Established companies raced to
set up Web sites, determined not to be perceived as falling behind the
times.  But in most cases, companies considered merelly having deployed
the site a great accomplishment; whether the site actually worked for
people was, at best, an afterthought.

   To gain market share against these first-movers, competitors often
add more and more content and functionality in hopes of drawing in new
customers.  This race to cram more features into products is hardly
unique to the Web.

   Having more features, however, turns out to be only a temporary
source of competitive advantage.  With the added complexity that comes
with ever-expanding feature set, sites become increasingly unwieldy,
hard to use, and unappealing to the very first-timers they are supposed
to draw in.  And still, many organizations pay little attention to what
users like, find valuable, or are really able to use.

   More and more businesses have now come to recognize that providing a
quality user experience is an essential, sustainable competitive
advantage.  It is user experience that forms the customer’s impression
of a company’s offerings; it is user experience that differentiates a
company from its competitors; and it is user experience that determines
whether your customer will ever come back.

1.6 Good User Exerience is Good Business
========================================

#+cindex; effective communication If your site consists of what Web pros
call _content_—that is, information—then one of the main goals of your
site is to communicate that information as effectively as possible.
It’s not enough just to put it out there.  It has be presented in a way
that helps people absorb it and understand it.  Otherwise, the user
might not ever find out that you offer the service or product they’re
looking for.  And even if they do manage to find that information
they’re likely to draw the conclusion that if your site is difficult to
work with, your company probably is as well.

   If your site is a Web-based application that people can use to
accomplish certain task, effective communication is a key factor in the
success of your product.  The world’s most powerful functionality
falters and fails if users can’t figure out how to make it work.

   Simply put, if your users have a bad experience, they won’t come
back.  If they have an OK experience with your site but a better
experience with your competitor’s site, they’ll go back to that
competitor, not you.  Features and functions always matter, but user
experience has a far greater effect on customer loyalty.  All of your
sophisticated technology and brand messaging won’t bring those customers
back a second time.  A good user experience will—and you don’t get much
of a second chance to get it right.

   Customer loyalty isn’t the only way that focusing on the user
experience of your site can pay off.  Businesses with an eye on the
bottom line want to know about the *return on investment*, or *ROI*. ROI
is usually measured in terms of money: For every dollar you spend, how
many dollars of value are you getting back?  That’s the ROI. But return
on investment does not have to be expressed in strictly monetary terms.
All you need is a measurement that shows that your money going out
translates into value for your company.

   One common measure of return on investment is *conversion rate*.  Any
time you want to encourage your customers to take the next step in
building a relationship with you—whether that involves something as
complex as customizing the site to their preferences or as simple as
signing up to receive an e-mail newsletter—there’s a conversion rate you
can measure.  By keeping track of what percentage of users you convert
to the next level, you can measure how effectively your site is meeting
your business goals.

   #+cindexz; work faster Any user experience effoert aims to increase
efficiency.  This comes in two key forms: helping people work faster and
helping them make fewer mistakes.  Improving the efficiency of the tools
you use improves the productivity of the business as a whole.  The less
time it takes to complete any given task, the more you can get done in a
day.  In keeping with the old notion that time is money, saving your
employees time translates direclty into saving your business money.

   People like their jobs more when their tools are natural and easy to
use, not frustrating and needlessly complex.

1.7 Minding Your Users
======================

User-Centered Design
====================

The practice of creating engaging, efficient user experience is called
*user-centered design*.  The concept of user-centered design is very
simple: Take the user into account every step of the way as you develop
your product.  The implications of this simple concept are surprisinly
complex.

   Everything the user experiences should be the result of a conscious
decision on your part.  Realistically, you might have to make a
compromise here and there because of the time or expense involved in
creating a better solution.  But a user-centered design process ensures
that those compromises don’t happen by accident.  By thinking about the
user experience, breaking it down into its component elements, and
looking at it from several perspectives, you can ensure that you know
all the ramifications of your decisions.

   The biggest reason user experience should matter to you is that it
matters to your users.  if you don’t provide them with a positive
experience, they won’t use your product.  And without users, all you’ve
got is a dusty Web serverr somewhere, idly waiting to fulfill a request
that will never come.  For the users who do come, you must set out to
provide them with an experience that is cohesive, intuitive, and maybe
even pleasurable—an experience in which everything works the way it
should.

2 Meet the Elements
*******************

The user experience design process is all about ensuring that no aspect
of the user’s experience with your product happens without your
conscious, explicit intent.  This means taking into account every
possibility of every action the user is likely to take and understanding
the user’s expectations at every step of the way through that process.

   By breaking the job of crafting user experience down into its
component elements, we can better understand the task as a whole.

2.1 The Five Planes
===================

Purchasing a physical product over the Web.  The experience is the same
every time:

   • go to the site
   • find the item (search engine or browsing a catalog)
   • give your credit card number, address
   • site confirms that the product will be shipped to you

   That neat, tidy experience actually results from a whole set of
decisions—some small, some large—about how the site looks, how it
behaves, and what it allows you to do.  These decisions build upon each
other, informing and invluencing all aspects of the user experience.

   If we peel away the layers of that experience, we can begin to
understand how those decisions are made.

* The Skeleton Plane::
* The Structure Plane::
* The Scope Plane::
* The Strategy Plane::


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: The Surface Plane,  Next: The Skeleton Plane,  Up: The Five Planes

2.1.1 The Surface Plane
-----------------------

On the *surface* you see a series of Web pages, made up of images and
text.  Some of these images are things you can click on, performing some
sort of function such as taking you to a shopping cart.  Some of these
images are just illustrations, such as a photograph of a product for
sale or the logo of the site itself.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: The Skeleton Plane,  Next: The Structure Plane,  Prev: The Surface Plane,  Up: The Five Planes

2.1.2 The Skeleton Plane
------------------------

Beneath that surface is the *skeleton* of the site: the placement of
buttons, controls, photos, and blocks of text.  The skeleton is designed
to optimize the arrangement of these elements for maximum effet and
efficiency—so that you remember the logo and can find that shopping cart
button when you need it.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: The Structure Plane,  Next: The Scope Plane,  Prev: The Skeleton Plane,  Up: The Five Planes

2.1.3 The Structure Plane
-------------------------

The skeleton is a concrete expression of the more abstract *structure*
of the site.  The skeleton might define the placement of the interface
elements on our checkout page; the structure would define how users got
to that page and where they could go when they were finished there.  The
skeleton might define the arrangement of navigational elements allowing
the users to browse categories of products; the structure would define
what those categories were.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: The Scope Plane,  Next: The Strategy Plane,  Prev: The Structure Plane,  Up: The Five Planes

2.1.4 The Scope Plane
---------------------

The structure defines the way in which the various features and
functions of the site fit together.  Just what those features and
functions are constitutes the *scope* of the site.  For example, some
commerce sites offer a feature that enables users to save previously
used shipping addresses so they can be used again.  Whether that
feature—or any feature—is included on a site is a question of scope.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: The Strategy Plane,  Prev: The Scope Plane,  Up: The Five Planes

2.1.5 The Strategy Plane
------------------------

The scope is fundamentally determined by the *strategy* of the site.
This strategy incorporates not only what the people running the site
want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the site as
well.  In the case of our store example, some of the strategic
objectives are pretty obvious—such as the the role that advertising or
content produced by our users plays in our business model, for
example—might not be so easy to articulate.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: Building From Bottom To Top,  Next: A Basic Duality,  Prev: The Five Planes,  Up: Meet the Elements

2.2 Building From Bottom To Top
===============================

These five planes:
  1. strategy
  2. scope
  3. structure
  4. skeleton
  5. surface

provide a conceptual framework for talking about user experience
problems and the tools we use to solve them.

Levels of Abstractness to Concretness
=====================================

On each plane, the issues we must deal with become a little less
abstract and a little more concrete.  On the lowest plane, we are not
concerned with the final shape of the site, product, or service at
all—we only care about how the site will fit into our strategy (while
meeting the needs of our users).  On the highest planem, we are only
concerned with the most concrete details of the appearance of the
product.  Plane by plane, the decisions we have to make become a little
more specific and involve finer levels of detail.

Interdependency Between Planes
==============================

Each plane is dependent on the planes below it.  So, the surface depends
on the skeleton which depends on the structure, whihc depends on the
scope, which depends on the strategy.  When the choices we make don’t
align with those above and below, projects derail, deadlines are missed,
and the costs begin to skyrocket as the development team tries to piece
together components that don’t naturally fit.  Even worse, when the
product finally does launch, users often hate it, because it doesn’t
deliver a satisfying experience.  This dependence means that decisions
on the strategy plane will have a sort of “ripple effect” all the way up
the chain.  Conversely, the choices available to use on each plane are
constrained by the decisions we make about issues on the planes below
it.

   That does not mean, however, that every decision about a lower plane
must be made before the plane above it can be addressed.  Dependencies
run in both directions, with decisions made on upper planes sometimes
forcing a reevaluation (or an evaluation made for the first time!)  of
issues on lower planes.  At each level, we make decisions according to
what the competition is doing, industry best practices, what we know
about our users, and plain old common sense.  These decisions can have a
ripple effect in both directions.

   If you consider your decisions on lower planes to be set in stone
before you take on your first decisions in higher planes, you will
almost certainly be throwing your project schedule—and possible the
success of your final product—into jeopardy.

   Instead, you should plan your project so that work on any plane
cannot _finish_ before work on lower planes has finished.  The important
consideration here is to not build the roof of the house before you know
the shape of the foundation.

2.3 A Basic Duality
===================

Of course, there are more than just five elements of user experience,
and as with any specialized field, this one has evolved a vocabulary all
its own.  To someone encountering the field for the first time, user
experience can appear to be a complicated business.  All these seemingly
identical terms are thrown around:
   • interaction design
   • information design
   • information architecture

What do they mean?  Anything?  Or are they just more meaningless
industry buzzwords?

   To further complicate matters, people will use the same terms in
different ways.  One person might use “information design” to refer to
what another knows as “information architecture.” And what’s the
difference between “interface design” and “interaction design?” Is there
one?

Evolution of the “Web”
======================

When the Web started, it was all about information.  People could create
documents, and they could link them to other documents.  Tim
Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, created it as a way for
researchers in the high-energy physics community, who were spread out
all over the world, to share and refer to each other’s findings.  He
knew the Web had the potential to be much more than that, but few others
really understood how great its potential was.

   People originally seized on the Web as a new publishing medium, but
as technology advanced and new features were added to Web browsers and
Web servers alike, the Web took on new functional capabilities.  After
the Web began to catch on in the larger Internet community, it developed
a more complex and robust feature set that would enable Web sites not
only to distribute information but to collect and manipulate it as well.
With this, the Web became more interactive, responding to the input of
users in ways that build upon and sometimes moved beyond traditional
desktop applications.

   With the advent of commercial interests on the Web, this application
functionality found a wide range of uses, such as electronic commerce,
social media, and financial services, among others.  Meanwhile, the Web
continued to flourish as a publishing medium, with countless newspapers
and magazine sites augmenting the wave of Web-only blogs and “e-zines”
being published.  Technology continued to advance on both fronts as all
kinds of sites made the transition from static collections of
information thtat changes infrequently to dynamic, database-driven sites
that were constantly evolving.

   When the Web user experience community started to form, its members
spoke two different languages.  One group saw every problem as an
application design problem, and applied problem-solving approaches from
the traditional desktop and mainframe software worlds.  (These, in turn,
were rooted in common practices applied to creating all kinds of
products, from cars to running shoes.)  The other group saw the Web in
terms of information distribution and retrieval, and applied
problem-solving approaches from the traditional worlds of publishing,
media, and information science.

   This became quite a stumbling block.  Very little progress could be
made when the community could not even agree on basic terminology.  The
waters were further muddied by the fact that most Web sites could not be
neatly categorized as either functional applications or information
resources—a huge numnber seemed to be a sort of hybrid, incorporating
qualities from each world.

Duality of Purpose: Funtional vs Informational
==============================================

To address this basic duality in the nature of the Web, let’s split our
five planes down the middle.  On the left, we’ll put those elements
specific to the Web as a platform for *functionality*.  On the right,
we’ll put the elements specific to the Web as an *information medium*.

Table 2.1: The Duality of Purpose: Function vs Information

Functionality—Tasks
-------------------

On the functionality side, we are mainly concerned with *tasks*—the
steps involved in a process and how people think about completing them.
Here, we consider the product as a tool or set of tools that the user
employs to accomplish one or more tasks.

Information Offered to Users
----------------------------

On the opposite side, our concern is what *information* the product
offers and what it means to our users.  Creating an information-rich
user experience is about enabling people to find, absorb, and make sense
of the information we provide.

2.4 The Elements of User Experience
===================================

Now we can map that whole confusing array of terms into the model.  By
breaking each plane down into its component elements, we will be able to
take a closer look at how all the pieces fit together in the course of
designing the whole user experience.

* Menu:

* The Strategy Plane: The Strategy Plane 1.
* The Scope Plane: The Scope Plane 1.
* The Structure Plane: The Structure Plane 1.
* The Skeleton Plane: The Skeleton Plane 1.
* The Surface Plane: The Surface Plane 1.

2.4.1 The Strategy Plane
------------------------

The same strategic concerns come into play for both
functionality-oriented products and information-oriented resources.
*User needs* are the goals for the site that come from outside our
organization—specifically from the people who will use our site.  We
must understand what our audience wants from us and how that fits in
with other goals they have.

   Balanced against user needs are our own objectives for the site.
These *product objectives* can be business goals (“Make $1 million in
sales over the Web this year”) or other kinds of goals (“Inform voters
about the candidates in the next election”).  In Chapter 3 we will go
into more detail about these elements.

2.4.2 The Scope Plane
---------------------

On the functionality side, the strategy is translated into scope through
the creation of *functional specifications*: a detailed description of
the “feature set” of the product.  On the information side, scope takes
the form of *content requirements*: a description of the various
elements that will be required.  Chapter 4 will cover the scope
elements.

2.4.3 The Structure Plane
-------------------------

The scope is given structure on the functionality side through
*interaction design*, in which we define how the system behaves in
response to the user.  For information resources, the structure is the
*information architecture*: the arrangement of content elements to
facilitate human understanding.  You’ll find more details on these in
Chapter 5.


File: elements-user_exp.info,  Node: The Skeleton Plane 1,  Next: The Surface Plane 1,  Prev: The Structure Plane 1,  Up: The Elements of User Experience

2.4.4 The Skeleton Plane
------------------------

The skeleton plane breaks down into three components.  On both sides, we
must address *information design*: the presentation of information in a
way that facilitates understanding.  For functionality-oriented
products, the skeleton also includes *interface design*, or arranging
interface elements to enable users to interact with the functionality of
the system.  The interface for an information resource is its
*navigation design*: the set of screen elements that allow the user to
move through the information architecture.  There’s more about the
skeleton plane in Chapter 6.

2.4.5 The Surface Plane
-----------------------

Finally we have the surface.  Regardless of whether we are dealing with
a functionality-oriented product or an information resource, our concern
here is the same: the *sensory experience* created by the finished
product.  It’s trickier than it sounds; you can find out all about it in
Chapter 7.

2.5 Using the Elements
======================

This model, divided up into neat boxes and planes, is a convenient way
to think about user experience problems.  In reality, of course, the
lines between these areas are not so clearly drawn.  Frequently, it can
be difficult to identify whether a particular user experience problem is
best solved through attention to one element instead of another.  Can a
change to the visuals do the trick, or will the underlying navigation
design have to be reworked?  Some problems require attention in several
areas at once, and some seem to straddle the borders identified in this
model.

   Few produces or services fall exclusively on one side of this model
or the other.  Within each plane, the elements must work together to
accomplish that plane’s goals.  Separating the effects of decisions you
make about one element from all other elements on the plane is
difficult.  For example, information design, navigation design, and
interface design jointly define the skeleton of a product.  All the
elements on every plane have a common functionality in determining the
larger user experience—in this case, defining the product’s
skeleton—even if they perform that function in different ways.

   The way organizations delegate responsibility for user experience
issues often complicates matters further.  In some organizations, you
will encounter people with job titles like _information architect_ or
_interface designer_.  Don’t be confused by this.  These people
generally have expertise spanning many of the elements of user
experience, not just the specialty indicated by their title.  It’s not
necessary to have a member of your team who is a specialist in each of
these areas; instead, you only have to ensure that someone spends at
least part of their time thinking about each of these issues.

Content and Technology Affecting User Experience
================================================

A couple of additional factors go into shaping the final user experience
that you won’t find covered in detail here.  The first is *content*.
The old saying (well, old in Web years) is that “content is king” on the
Web.  This is absolutely true—the single most important thing most Web
sites can offer to their users is content that those users will find
valuable.

   Users don’t visit Web sites to experience the joy of navigation.  The
content that is available to you (or that you have resources to obtain
and manage) will play a huge role in shaping your site.  In the case of
an online store, you might decide that you want the users to be able to
see cover images of all the books you sell.  If you can get them, will
you have a way to catalog them, keep track of them, and keep them up to
date?  And what if you can’t get photos of the book covers at all?
These content questions are essential to the ultimate user experience of
the site.

   Second, *technology* can be just as important as content in creating
a successful user experience.  In many cases, the nature of the
experience you provide your users is largely determined by technology.
In the early days of the Web, the tools to connect Web sites to
databases were fairly primitive and limited.  As the technology has
advanced, however, databases have become more widely used to drive Web
sites.  This in turn has enabled more and more sophisticated user
experience approaches, such as dynamic navigation systems that change in
response to the way users move through the site.  Technology is always
changing, and the field of user experience always has to adapty to it.
Nevertheless, the fundamental elements of user experience remain the
same.

Elements Apply Universally
==========================

Although the author developed the Elements model in the course of his
work on Web sites, others have since applied it to a wide range of
products and services.  If you work on the Web, everything in this book
applies to you.  If you work on other kinds of technology products, you
will see strong parallels to familiar considerations.  Even if you work
on products or services that have nothing to do with technology, you can
map these concepts to your own processes.

   The rest of this book looks at these elements, plane by plane, in
greater detail.  We’ll take a closer look at some of the tools and
techniques commonly used to address each element.  Along the way, we’ll
see how these elements come into play in products that aren’t Web sites
at all.  We’ll see what the elements on each plane have in common, what
makes each one different, and how they affect each other to help us
create the total user experience.
