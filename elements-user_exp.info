To the Second Edition
=====================

This book is no longer just about web sites.  Overall, the themes,
concepts, and principles apply to products and services of all kinds.

   The field of user experience has broadened its horizons.
Practitioners now regularly talk about the impact and value of user
experience design in areas far beyond the limited context of the Web or
even screen-based interactive applications that dominated the
conversation back when this book was first written.

   The Web is still central to the book, if only to acknowledge the
model’s roots in that medium.  But this book doesn’t require an
insider’s knowledge of how Web development happens—so even if you don’t
create Web sites, you should be able to see how to apply these ideas in
your own work.

To the First Edition
====================

This is not a how-to book.  There are many books out there that explain
how Web sites get made.  This is not one of them.

   This is not a book about technology.  There is not a single line of
code to be found between these covers.

   This is not a book of answers.  Instead, this book is about asking
the right questions.

   This book will tell you what you need to know before you go read
those other books.  If you need the big picture, if you need to
understand the context for the decisions that user experience
practitioners make, this book is for you.

   This book is designed to be read easily in just a few hours.  If
you’re a newcomer to the world of user experience, this book will give
you the foundation you need.  If you’re already familiar with the
methods and concerns of the field of user experience, this book will
help you communicate them more effectively to the people you work with.

1 User Experience and Why It Matters

Products and services are made by people and someone, somewhere should
get the credit when they work well for us—or get the blame when they
don’t.

1.1 Everyday Miseries
=====================

Everyone, every once in a while, has one of those days.

1.2 Introducing User Experience
===============================

   • The accident
   • The register
   • The pump
   • The coffeemaker
   • The Clock

   In short, every one of the previous cases of “bad luck” could have
been avoided had someone made different choices in designing a product
or service.  These examples all demonstrate a lack of attention to the
*user experience*: the experience the product creates for the people who
use it in the real world.  When a product is being developed, people pay
a great deal of attention to what it does.  User experience is the
other, often overlooked, side of the equation—how it works—that can
often make the difference between a successful product and a failure.

   User experience is not about the inner workings of a product or
service.  User experience is about how it works on the outside, where a
person comes into contact with it.  When someone asks you what it’s like
to use a product or service, they’re asking about the user experience.
Is it hard to do simple things?  Is it easy to figure out?  How does it
feel to interact with the product?

   That interaction often involves pushing a lot of buttons, as in the
case of technology products such as alarm clocks, coffeemakers, or cash
registers.  Sometimes its just a matter of simply physical mechanism,
such as the gas cap on your car.  However, every product that is used by
someone creates a user experience: books, ketchup bottles, reclining
armchairs, cardigan sweaters.

   For any kind of product or service, its the little things that count.
Having a button click when you push it down doesn’t seem like much, but
when that click makes the difference between getting coffee and not
getting coffee, it matters a great deal.  Even if you never realized
that the design of that button was causing you trouble, how would you
feel about a coffeemaker that you were able to use successfully only
party of the time?  How would you feel about the manufacturer?  Would
you buy another product from that company in the future?  Probably not.
Thus, for want of a button that clicks, a customer is lost.

1.3 From Product Design to User Experience Design
=================================================

When most people think about product design, they often think of it in
terms of aesthetic appeal: a well-designed product is one that looks
good to the eye and feels good to the touch.  Whether it’s the curve of
a sports car’s body or the texture of a power drill’s grip, the
aesthetic dimension of product design is a sure attention-grabber.

   Another common way people think about product design is in functional
terms: A well-designed product is one that does what it promises to do.
And a badly-designed product is one that somehow doesn’t: scissors that
don’t cut even though the blades are sharp, a pen that doesn’t write
even though it’s full of ink, a printer that constantly jams.

   All of these can certainly be failures of design.  These products
might look great and work well functionally, but designing products with
the user experience as an explicit oucome means looking beyond the
functional or aesthetic.

   #+cindex; product development Some people responsible for creating
products may not think in terms of design at all.  For them, the process
of creating a product is about development: steadily builidng up and
refining the features and functionalities of the product until they add
up to something viable to the marketplace.

   In this view, the design of a product is dictated by its
functionality—or, as designers sometimes put it, “form follows
function.” This approach makes complete sense for the inner workings of
a product, the parts concealed from a user.  But when it comes to teh
parts of a product that are user-facing—the buttons, displays, labels,
and so forth—the “correct” form isn’t dictated by functionality at all.
Instead, its dictated by the psychology and behavior of the users
themselves.

   User experience design often deals with questions of context.
Aesthetic design makes ure the button on the coffeemaker is an appealing
shape and texture.  Functional design makes sure it triggers the
appropriate action on the device.  User experience design makes sure the
aesthetic and functional aspects of the button work in the context of
the rest of the product, asking questions like, “Is the button too small
for such an important function?” User experience design also makes sure
the button works in the context of what the user is trying to
accomplish, asking such quesstions like, “Is the button in the right
place relative to the other controls the user would be using at the same
time?”

1.4 Designing (for) Experience—Use Matters
==========================================

What’s the difference between desigining a product and designing a user
experience?  After all, every product intended for humans has a user,
and every time a product is used, it delivers an experience.  The
product can fail to deliver a satisfactory experience.

   Manufacturers tend not to employ user experience designers.  In
simple cases, the requirements to deliver a successful user experience
are built into the definition of the product itself.

   With more complex products, the requirements to deliver a successful
user experience are independent of the definition of the product.

   And the more complex a product is, the more difficult it becomes to
identify exactly how to deliver a successful experience to the user.
Each additional feature, function, or step in the process of using a
product creates another opportunity for the experience to fall short.
As a result, the process of creating a successful product has to be
quite different.  That’s where product design has to be supported by
user experience design.

1.5 User Experience and the Web
===============================

User experience is vital to all kinds of products and services.  This
book is primarily about the user experience of one particular kind of
product: Web sites.  (_Site_ here refers to both content-oriented Web
products and interactive Web applications.)

   On the Web, user experience becomes even more important than it is
for other kinds of products.  The lessons we’ve learned from creating
user experience on the Web can be applied far beyond its boundaries.

   Web sites are complicated pieces of technology, and something funny
happens when people have trouble using complicated pieces of technology:
They blame themselves.  They feel like they must have done something
wrong.  They feel like they weren’t paying enough attention.  They feel
stupid.  Sure, it’s irrational.  After all, it’s not their fault the
site doesn’t work the wey they expect it to.  But they feel stupid
anyway.  And if you intend to drive people away from your site, it’s
hard to imagine a more effective approach than making them feel stupid
when they use it.

   Regardless of the type of site, in virtually every case, a Web site
is a self-service product.  There is no instruction manual to read
beforehand, no training seminar to attend, no customer service
representative to help guide the user through the site.  There is only
the user, facing the site alone with only her wits and personal
experience to guide her.

   It’s bad enough that she’s been stuck in the position of having to
figure out the site on her own.  The fact that most sites don’t even
acknowledge her helpless condition only makes matters worse., Despite
the vital strategic importance of user experience to the success of a
Web site, the simple matter of understanding what people want and need
has been a low priority for most of the history of the medium.

   If user experience is such a vital part of any Web site, why is it so
often neglected in the development process?  Many Web sites are built
with the idea that being first to market is the key to success,.  In the
earliest days of the Web, sites like Yahoo!  built early leads that
later competitors struggled to overcome.  Established companies raced to
set up Web sites, determined not to be perceived as falling behind the
times.  But in most cases, companies considered merelly having deployed
the site a great accomplishment; whether the site actually worked for
people was, at best, an afterthought.

   To gain market share against these first-movers, competitors often
add more and more content and functionality in hopes of drawing in new
customers.  This race to cram more features into products is hardly
unique to the Web.

   Having more features, however, turns out to be only a temporary
source of competitive advantage.  With the added complexity that comes
with ever-expanding feature set, sites become increasingly unwieldy,
hard to use, and unappealing to the very first-timers they are supposed
to draw in.  And still, many organizations pay little attention to what
users like, find valuable, or are really able to use.

   More and more businesses have now come to recognize that providing a
quality user experience is an essential, sustainable competitive
advantage.  It is user experience that forms the customer’s impression
of a company’s offerings; it is user experience that differentiates a
company from its competitors; and it is user experience that determines
whether your customer will ever come back.

1.6 Good User Exerience is Good Business
========================================

#+cindex; effective communication If your site consists of what Web pros
call _content_—that is, information—then one of the main goals of your
site is to communicate that information as effectively as possible.
It’s not enough just to put it out there.  It has be presented in a way
that helps people absorb it and understand it.  Otherwise, the user
might not ever find out that you offer the service or product they’re
looking for.  And even if they do manage to find that information
they’re likely to draw the conclusion that if your site is difficult to
work with, your company probably is as well.

   If your site is a Web-based application that people can use to
accomplish certain task, effective communication is a key factor in the
success of your product.  The world’s most powerful functionality
falters and fails if users can’t figure out how to make it work.

   Simply put, if your users have a bad experience, they won’t come
back.  If they have an OK experience with your site but a better
experience with your competitor’s site, they’ll go back to that
competitor, not you.  Features and functions always matter, but user
experience has a far greater effect on customer loyalty.  All of your
sophisticated technology and brand messaging won’t bring those customers
back a second time.  A good user experience will—and you don’t get much
of a second chance to get it right.

   Customer loyalty isn’t the only way that focusing on the user
experience of your site can pay off.  Businesses with an eye on the
bottom line want to know about the *return on investment*, or *ROI*. ROI
is usually measured in terms of money: For every dollar you spend, how
many dollars of value are you getting back?  That’s the ROI. But return
on investment does not have to be expressed in strictly monetary terms.
All you need is a measurement that shows that your money going out
translates into value for your company.

   One common measure of return on investment is *conversion rate*.  Any
time you want to encourage your customers to take the next step in
building a relationship with you—whether that involves something as
complex as customizing the site to their preferences or as simple as
signing up to receive an e-mail newsletter—there’s a conversion rate you
can measure.  By keeping track of what percentage of users you convert
to the next level, you can measure how effectively your site is meeting
your business goals.

   #+cindexz; work faster Any user experience effoert aims to increase
efficiency.  This comes in two key forms: helping people work faster and
helping them make fewer mistakes.  Improving the efficiency of the tools
you use improves the productivity of the business as a whole.  The less
time it takes to complete any given task, the more you can get done in a
day.  In keeping with the old notion that time is money, saving your
employees time translates direclty into saving your business money.

   People like their jobs more when their tools are natural and easy to
use, not frustrating and needlessly complex.

1.7 Minding Your Users
======================

The practice of creating engaging, efficient user experience is called
*user-centered design*.  The concept of user-centered design is very
simple: Take the user into account every step of the way as you develop
your product.  The implications of this simple concept are surprisinly
complex.

   Everything the user experiences should be the result of a conscious
decision on your part.  Realistically, you might have to make a
compromise here and there because of the time or expense involved in
creating a better solution.  But a user-centered design process ensures
that those compromises don’t happen by accident.  By thinking about the
user experience, breaking it down into its component elements, and
looking at it from several perspectives, you can ensure that you know
all the ramifications of your decisions.

   The biggest reason user experience should matter to you is that it
matters to your users.  if you don’t provide them with a positive
experience, they won’t use your product.  And without users, all you’ve
got is a dusty Web serverr somewhere, idly waiting to fulfill a request
that will never come.  For the users who do come, you must set out to
provide them with an experience that is cohesive, intuitive, and maybe
even pleasurable—an experience in which everything works the way it
should.
