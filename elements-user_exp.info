To the Second Edition
=====================

This book is no longer just about web sites.  Overall, the themes,
concepts, and principles apply to products and services of all kinds.

   The field of user experience has broadened its horizons.
Practitioners now regularly talk about the impact and value of user
experience design in areas far beyond the limited context of the Web or
even screen-based interactive applications that dominated the
conversation back when this book was first written.

   The Web is still central to the book, if only to acknowledge the
model’s roots in that medium.  But this book doesn’t require an
insider’s knowledge of how Web development happens—so even if you don’t
create Web sites, you should be able to see how to apply these ideas in
your own work.

To the First Edition
====================

This is not a how-to book.  There are many books out there that explain
how Web sites get made.  This is not one of them.

   This is not a book about technology.  There is not a single line of
code to be found between these covers.

   This is not a book of answers.  Instead, this book is about asking
the right questions.

   This book will tell you what you need to know before you go read
those other books.  If you need the big picture, if you need to
understand the context for the decisions that user experience
practitioners make, this book is for you.

   This book is designed to be read easily in just a few hours.  If
you’re a newcomer to the world of user experience, this book will give
you the foundation you need.  If you’re already familiar with the
methods and concerns of the field of user experience, this book will
help you communicate them more effectively to the people you work with.
